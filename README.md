# Origin / Use

Based on work at the 3rd DataPLANT ARC Hackathon in October 2022, a teaching-material-repository was developed for initial development and optimization.  

The repository provided [here](https://github.com/nfdi4plants/teaching-materials-concept) represents and presents the evolved concept as of March 2022.  

A [teaching materials section](https://github.com/nfdi4plants/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/tree/main/src/docs/teaching-materials) based on this concept has already been integrated into the [DataPLANT Knowledge Base](https://nfdi4plants.org/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase/index.html) [repsitory](https://github.com/nfdi4plants/nfdi4plants.knowledgebase). 

The concept in [this repository](https://github.com/nfdi4plants/teaching-materials-concept) has been summarized as a contribution to [NFDI CoRDI](https://www.nfdi.de/cordi-2023/?lang=en).
